WARNING!

Version 2.0 of this software should only be used with the EFIS software version 3.0 and the AHRS software version 2.0. 
This is due to the essential modifications to the CAN bus configuration required after removing the UART serial communication line that previously existed between the EFIS and the AHRS.
Version 1.0 should be used with EFIS V 2.5 and AHRS V 1.3.
